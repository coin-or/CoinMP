
CoinMP.dll is a Windows dynamic linked library (DLL) that supports most 
of the functionality of COIN-OR LP, COIN-OR Branch-and-Cut and Cut Generation 
Library projects.  This CoinMP.dll distribution of the COIN-OR projects for 
Windows has the advantages of being: high portability, does not require any 
compilation, easy to use, and can be used from any other Windows application.  

For information how to build CoinMP, see the INSTALL file in the folder above.

To use CoinMP in your own application, link in the CoinMP.lib file in the 
CoinMP\MSVisualStudio\v8\Release folder and copy the CoinMP.dll file to the 
same directory as your application.  The header file CoinMP.h in the CoinMP\src 
folder contains the prototypes for all the functions in the DLL.

The interface to this library designed to be as simple as possible, but still 
provide similar functionality as other solver DLL's availble.

The CoinMP.dll file will work as is with the MPL for Windows Modeling System by
Maximal Software.  Simply copy the DLL file into the Mplwin4 installation directory
and restart MPL.
